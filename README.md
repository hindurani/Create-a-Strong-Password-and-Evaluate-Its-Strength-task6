# Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength-task6
## Overview:
This repository contains the deliverables for Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength as part of the Eleyate Cybersecurity Internship. The task focuses on understanding what makes a password strong, testing passwords with an online strength checker, and analyzing password security against common attacks.

## Objective:
Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.
Test passwords using an online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com).
Document the results and identify best practices for creating strong passwords.
Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary) and summarize their impact on password security.

## Repository Contents:
Report.md: A detailed report summarizing the task, including:
Passwords created and their characteristics.
Strength test results (scores, feedback, and crack time estimates).
Best practices for strong passwords.
Explanation of common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
Lessons learned and tips for password security.
Screenshots/: Folder containing screenshots of password strength test results from the online tool.
README.md: This file, explaining the task and repository contents.

## Methodology:
## Password Creation:
Created five passwords with varying complexity:
Weak: password (lowercase, 8 characters)
Moderate: Password123 (upper, lower, numbers, 10 characters)
Strong: P@ssw0rd!2023 (upper, lower, numbers, symbols, 13 characters)
Very Strong: Tr0ub4dor&3xplor3r! (all types, 18 characters)
Passphrase: MyDogLoves2Run! (all types, 15 characters)

## Password Testing:
Tested each password using passwordmeter.com.
Recorded strength scores, feedback, and estimated crack times.
Captured screenshots of results (stored in the Screenshots/ folder).

## Research:
Researched brute force and dictionary attacks using online resources (e.g., OWASP, NIST).
Analyzed how password complexity impacts security against these attacks.


## Report:
Compiled findings into Report.md, including a table of results, best practices.

## Key Findings:
Password Strength: Longer passwords (12+ characters) with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols are significantly harder to crack.
Best Practices:
Use 12-16+ characters.
Include diverse character types.
Avoid common words or predictable patterns.
Use passphrases for memorability and strength.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and use password managers.

## Common Attacks:
Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations; mitigated by longer, complex passwords.
Dictionary Attack: Uses common words/phrases; mitigated by avoiding dictionary words.

## Lessons Learned:
Password managers simplify secure password management.
Regular testing with strength checkers ensures robust passwords.
MFA adds critical security beyond passwords.
